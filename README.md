# sidorowicz.co

sidorowicz.co is a PR company that needed a simple, fun website to present skills and portfolio.

The design doesn't consist of any photos so it's all about fonts, colors, movement and floating little spots, which was a lot of fun to code.

I built the site using [GRAV flat file CMS](https://getgrav.org/).
